# processing.input
A simple p5.js and Processing add-on to let you use input. Just simply add to your code!

# Options

```keysHeld``` is a string with all the keys pressed stored in it.
```aKeyPressed``` is detecting when a key is pressed (just a merge of keyPressed in processing and keyIsPressed in p5.js basically so your projects are easier to convert to p5.js/processing)
```theKey``` is the last key pressed
```keysLog``` is a string containing all keys ever pressed.

# Add it

# p5.js

Download the p5.input.js file and add

```
<script src="p5.input.js"></script>
```

to your code.

# Processing (as of version 4)

Copy and paste the processing.input.pde file to your code.

# Demo

There is a demonstration of p5.input.js and how it works [here](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1383233).


It is also shown on the [p5js libraries site](https://p5js.org/libraries/).
